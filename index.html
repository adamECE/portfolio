            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                My goal is to pursue a Software Engineering internship position in a company that is 
                developing innovative technology and develop a dynamic skill set to tackle 
                modern engineering challenges. I'm currently a Junior majoring in Software 
                Engineering at the University of Arizona with a minor in Computer Science. 
                I'm also a year-round Software Engineering intern at Raytheon Missiles and Defense, 
                where I primarily work in embedded testing. Outside of work, I'm extremely involved 
                on campus by being the Financial chair of the Japanese American Student Association. 
                Outside of school and work, I enjoy cooking, chess, and learning about different cultures.

            <p>
                Raytheon Missiles and Defense is the world's leading developers in defense integration. 
                As a Software Products Intern at Raytheon, I've developed a deeper understanding of embedded software 
                and industry level development. 
                My current tasks involve writing test scripts for telemetry data, running simulations, and performing 
                reviews on embedded code. Development is primarily done using C++, MATLAB, and occasionally Python. 
                During my time at Raytheon, I have also become familiar with the agile development methodology.
            </p>
            <h2>Other Professional Experience</h2>
            <p>
                Before joining Raytheon, I was an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for an introductory C course 
                at the University of Arizona for the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and a server 
                at a local sushi restaurant. In high school, I was a business intern for a local Chick-fil-A. 
                During the outbreak of COVID-19, I was responsible for making a proposal to the philanthropy team of 
                the Arizona Diamondbacks in order to raise funding to provide sandwiches to local hospitals.

                Besides my knowledge of embedded systems from Raytheon, 
                I'm also experienced in web development. I am most familiar with the MERN stack and have 
                implemented it in the majority of my school/personal projects, but I have recently started becoming 
                familiar with Angular and Vue.

                This Project Management App was designed for users to manage software tasks via the agile methodology, similar

                using NextJS and MongoDB. I'm continuing to add more user-friendly features so I can deploy the project and test it's 
                feasibility with some student volunteers.

            <h2>Heart Rate Tracker Application</h2>
            <p> 
                This project was created for the Web Development and Internet of Things Course in a 
                team of three students. The intention was to create a Heart Rate Monitor application, 
                in which we used a Particle Argon microcontroller to send heart rate data to our server. 
                As shown above, the application had a responsive and user friendly layout.  
                Our application was capable of managing different user accounts and displaying daily 
                heart rate data. I was primarily in charge of the backend development in this assignment, 
                but I have personally modified frontend elements to be more responsive and user-friendly 
                since the completion of the course.

                This web application was created as a way to become more familiar with web development. 
                The intent was to create a simple calendar application, with a few other features, that would 
                allow the user to manage their schedule. Designed using react, the application makes use of 
                the Open Weather API, the react-big-calendar and date-picker libraries, and has a responsive layout.

            <h2> University of Arizona Software Engineering Touchscreen Display System </h2>
            <p> 
                For my Introduction to Software Engineering II course, our final project was to 
                create an interactive application for a touchscreen display monitor outside of the Software
                Engineering office. Since the course was a Java focused class, we decided to use the 
                javaFX library to design our GUI. I was in a team of three students, where I primarily worked 
                on the functionality of the application, as well as a handful of frontend elements. Ultimately, 
                our project was chosen to be displayed on the display year-round. I've also been employed by the
                University to make changes to upkeep the system and make changes.
